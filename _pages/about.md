Hello! I am a M.S. student at Sungkyunkwan University in South Korea. I am a member of the [CSI-Agent Group](https://sites.google.com/view/csi-agent-group/about?authuser=0) and am being advised by Professor [Honguk Woo](https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?user=Gaxjc7UAAAAJ&hl=en).

My research focuses on language grounding for embodied control, particularly in developing efficient systems that can bridge the gap between large language models and physical robot actions. Specifically, I work on enabling robots to accomplish complex tasks in diverse environments and make LLMs reasoning align with physical environmental contexts.

Prior to my graduate studies, I earned a B.S degree in mathematics from Sungkyunkwan University.
