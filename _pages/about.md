Hello! I am a M.S. student at Sungkyunkwan University in South Korea. I am a member of the [CSI-Agent Group](https://sites.google.com/view/csi-agent-group/about?authuser=0) and am being advised by Professor [Honguk Woo](https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?user=Gaxjc7UAAAAJ&hl=en).

My research interest lies at the intersection of natural language processing (NLP) and reinforcement learning (RL). This involves grounding advanced language models in real-world robotic agents to enable them to perform complex tasks across various environments. It also includes using RL to address the alignment problem in language models.

Prior to my graduate studies, I completed a B.S degree in mathematics, and I am currently working as a Research Intern at LG AI Research.
