Hello!  I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Sciences at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison. 
Previously, I received my M.S. and B.S. degrees from Sungkyunkwan University in South Korea. During my M.S., I was a member of the [CSI-Agent Group](https://sites.google.com/view/csi-agent-group/about?authuser=0), advised by Professor [Honguk Woo](https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?user=Gaxjc7UAAAAJ&hl=en).

Currently, I am particularly interested in equipping robots with the ability to adapt to non-stationary environments, integrate reasoning from large language models with low-level control, and leverage world knowledge for long-horizon planning and interaction.
